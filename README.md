# Stock-Market-Predictor
the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. 

The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values.

The stock market is known for being volatile, dynamic, and nonlinear. 
Accurate stock price prediction is extremely challenging because of multiple (macro and micro) factors, such as politics, global economic conditions, unexpected events, a company's financial performance, and so on

The idea is to weigh out the importance of recent and older data and determine which parameters affect the “current” or “next” day prices the most. 
The machine learning model assigns weights to each market feature and determines how much history the model should look at to predict future stock prices
